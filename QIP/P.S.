Project on Quant Research 

The Google Drive link contains 1 month of 1m OHLC candlestick data and Aggregated Trades data for BTC/USDT for the month of November.The Aggregate Trades dataset is pretty big(>2 million rows) so you may face some processing difficulties depending on your PC specs so would recommend to use polars instead of pandas. 
The task requires some(at least 2) or all of the following: 
● Machine Learning Applications: Build and train machine learning models to predict price movements, identify market anomalies, or generate trading signals. 
● High-Frequency Trading: Analyze the feasibility and potential profitability of 
high-frequency trading strategies based on aggregated trades data. 
● Trend Analysis: Identify and analyze trends in price, volume, and 
volatility using moving averages, Bollinger Bands, or Relative Strength 
Index (RSI).
